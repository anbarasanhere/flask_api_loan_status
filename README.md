**Objective**

- To build a robust machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will default on a loan using multiple business and financial indicators, and to deploy the model via a web interface.

- Dataset Summary
-  Source: Internal banking dataset
- Observations: 150,000 rows
- Features: 26 input variables including loan term, employment numbers, disbursement amount, franchise status, urban/rural category, SBA approval values, etc.
- Target: MIS_Status – Indicates whether the customer is a defaulter (CHGOFF) or non-defaulter (PIF)
- Tools & Technologies Used
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Flask, Pickle
- Web Framework: Flask
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Key Features
- Extensive data cleaning, imputation, and feature engineering
- Feature selection using ExtraTreesClassifier and XGBoost
- Model comparison using:
- XGBoost (Accuracy: ~99%)
- Random Forest
-Naive Bayes
- LightGBM
- Deployed web app allows real-time loan default prediction with a clean UI

Deployment
The web application is hosted using Flask with an HTML interface. The model was serialized using pickle and loaded into the Flask app for prediction.

How to Run
Clone this repo
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run python app.py
Access the app via localhost:5000
Usage
The user inputs loan-related details such as:

Loan Term
Number of Employees
Urban/Rural Indicator
SBA Approval amount, etc.
The application predicts whether the loan is likely to default or safe to approve.

Impact
This system empowers banks and financial institutions to:

Reduce loan default risk
Speed up approval workflows
Maintain financial health through predictive insights
